1. 
Deep learning is an artificial intelligence (AI) function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data 
and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence 
that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural 
learning or deep neural network.



Activation function is a function that is added into an artificial neural network in order to help the network learn complex
patterns in the data. When comparing with a neuron-based model that is in our brains, the activation function is at the end 
deciding what is to be fired to the next neuron.It takes in the output signal from the previous cell and converts it into 
some form that can be taken as input to the next cell.
Non Linear Activation functions are
-Sigmoid
-Tanh
-Leaky 
-ReLU 
-Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU

Supervised learning is the learning of the model where with input variable ( say, x) and an output variable (say, Y) 
and an algorithm to map the input to the output.
 i.e Y = f(X)
For example Suppose there is a basket which is filled with some fresh fruits, the task is to arrange the same type of 
fruits at one place.Also, suppose that the fruits are apple, banana, cherry, grape.Suppose one already knows from 
their previous work that, the shape of each and every fruit present in the basket so, it is easy for them to arrange 
the same type of fruits in one place. Here, the previous work is called as training data in. So, it learns the things 
from the training data. This is because it has a response variable which says y that if some fruit has so and so 
features then it is grape, and similarly for each and every fruit. 

Unsupervised learning is where only the input data (say, X) is present and no corresponding output variable is there.
Again, Suppose there is a basket and it is filled with some fresh fruits. The task is to arrange the same type of 
fruits at one place.This time there is no information about those fruits beforehand, its the first time that the 
fruits are being seen or discovered.So how to group similar fruits without any prior knowledge about those.
First, any physical characteristic of a particular fruit is selected. Suppose color.Then the fruits are arranged 
on the basis of the color. The groups will be something as shown below:
RED COLOR GROUP: apples & cherry fruits.
GREEN COLOR GROUP: bananas & grapes.

So now, take another physical character say, size, so now the groups will be something like this.
RED COLOR AND BIG SIZE: apple.
RED COLOR AND SMALL SIZE: cherry fruits.
GREEN COLOR AND BIG SIZE: bananas.
GREEN COLOR AND SMALL SIZE: grapes.
The job is done!
Here, there is no need to know or learn anything beforehand. That means, no train data and no response variable. 
This type of learning is known as Unsupervised Learning
